# Histopathologic Cancer Detection Using Deep Learning

This project focuses on automating cancer detection using deep learning techniques, specifically Convolutional Neural Networks (CNNs), to analyze histopathological images. By leveraging CNNs, the system can extract intricate patterns and features from digitized slides, enabling accurate classification of images as malignant or non-malignant. The dataset includes a diverse range of histopathological images, which undergo preprocessing to enhance quality for robust model training. The model is validated on independent datasets to ensure high sensitivity and specificity while minimizing false positives and negatives. Additionally, visualization techniques are incorporated to interpret the modelâ€™s decision-making process, ensuring reliability and transparency. This automated system aims to improve diagnostic accuracy, reduce pathologists' workload, and expedite cancer detection, contributing to advancements in medical image analysis and patient care.
